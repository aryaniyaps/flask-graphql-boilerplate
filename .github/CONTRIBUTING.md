## Our Development Process

All changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes.
We actively welcome your pull requests and invite you to submit pull requests directly
[here](https://github.com/codebyaryan/flask-graphql-boilerplate/pulls), and after review, these can be merged into the project.

## Developer notes

The boilerplate must not be very opinionated. It should provide a basic set of features
which must be easily extensible.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch (usually named `patch-%the number of PRs you've already made%`).
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add some test examples.
3. Ensure to describe your pull request.

## Feature Request

Great Feature Requests tend to have:

- A quick idea summary.
- What & why you wanted to add the specific feature.
- Additional context like images, links to resources to implement the feature etc, etc.
