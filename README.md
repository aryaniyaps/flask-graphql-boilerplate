  a Flask template for <a href="https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a> to get you up and running, powered by GraphQL.
</p>

## Motivation â›µ

The GraphQL community is relatively new, and there are fewer resources to help you get started with it in the Python ecosystem. While I started to write
GraphQL projects with Python, I experienced a lot of friction, and wrote a lot of boilerplate code. Eventually, I figured out that it would be easier to
make a template which would help me to get up and running. This template uses a lot of modern libraries to provide the best developer experience. Today, I
mostly start off my projects with this template.
